                    Welcome to my website! I’m Akshat, a Computer Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo. The boundless nature of 
                    technology has fascinated me since I could string letters together; it is that same passion that has driven me to Software Development, 
                    most recently working at the Ford Motor Company and Deep Trekker. While I have experience in full-stack, front-end, and back-end development
                    , I welcome all opportunities that enable me to use my technological prowess to create meaningful change. 
                    When I am not coding, I enjoy practicing Martial Arts, trying out different Cafés around the city, and watching the NBA. 
                    <br/> <br/>
                    I am currently seeking Summer 2024 internships; if you have
                    any questions about anything outlined on this website or about my candidature, 
                    please feel free to contact me.
